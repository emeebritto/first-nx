Life won’t stop presenting choices and you can’t stop making choices.

Not all choices will be easy, sometimes you'd want to do both, sometimes none. It’s your choice.

The future you want and eventually get depends on the choices you make on daily basis.

While making these choices listen to yourself. You cannot rely on someone else’s judgment.

We are the product of all the choices that we make each day.

The combination of all the good and bad choices that we make decides who we are.

Sometimes, the best choices are the hardest and sometimes the easiest.

Busy your mind with concepts of harmony, health, peace, and goodwill, and wonders will happen in your life.

You think with your conscious mind, and whatever you habitually think sinks down into your subconscious mind. Once the subconscious mind accepts an idea, it begins to execute it.

The law of mind is the law of belief. It is not the thing believed in, but the belief in your own mind, which brings about the result.

Take a deep breath, feel the density of air in your nostrils, and simply say, “I am not what my mind says, I can do this, and I will do it!

The reason people cannot make better connections is because they name a scenario in their heads and act accordingly which has nothing to do with the present situation.

Please don’t act upon anxiety or previous experiences, yes just try to start afresh, you deserve this chance.

Happiness is a state, not a trait; meaning, it isn’t a long-lasting, permanent feature or personality trait, but a more fleeting state.

happiness is a state of mind. Finding happiness is like finding yourself.

Self-actualization is a process of discovering who you are, who you want to be, and paving your way to happiness by doing what brings you the most meaning and contentment in your life over the long run.

be focused on your personal growth.

focus on practicing gratitude for the things you have and enjoying the process as you go.

reframe your negative thoughts, when you find yourself struck by a pessimistic outlook or experiencing negativity, look for ways that you can reframe your thoughts in a more positive approach.

A sense of purpose involves seeing your life as having goals, direction, and meaning.

don’t base your happiness on goals

Happiness isn’t something you’ll get in the market, ready for you to buy, it comes from your own actions. It’s not a goal, but a by-product of a life well-lived.

Happiness comes from being who you are instead of who you think you are supposed to be.

Don’t wait for someone else to make you happy, it isn’t anyone’s responsibility but yours to make yourself happy.

If it makes you happy, no one else’s opinion should matter. You deserve it.

Invest. Start as soon as possible.

Confront negative thoughts when they come and deconstruct them.

Be curious

Seek advice. It’s OK to ask for help.

Life is short and our time here is finite. Make the most of it. Don’t fret about the future.

Celebrate who you are everyday.

Express gratitude all day long.

Believe in yourself.

remove toxic people from your circle, set boundaries.

Life doesn’t happen to you, it happens for you.

enjoy every damn thing.

Write a list of the things you’re grateful for. no for me, but for you.

Truthfully our age does not define who we are or what we do.

Make your today better than your yesterday.

Comparing your success with that of others is not something you should do.
