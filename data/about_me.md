I am a current undergraduate Computer Science major at George Mason University.
I will be graduating May 2026 and plan to work in the industry.
After a few years in industry, I will pursue a doctorate in Economics.
I was an intern at Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates at Tufts University as a researcher.
I worked at Tuft’s University AABL (The Assistive Agent Behavior and Learning Lab) from June 2021 to August 2021.
Their main goal is to create new algorithms for human-robot interaction and evaluate whether the algorithm would work in real life.
I researched the changes in human feedback given to a robot learning a task changes over time.
I can't give more information about my research.
My interests are data mining, Machine Learning, and mostly artificial intelligence.
I also enjoy analyzing the correlation between economics and technology has in society.
As a computer science major, I would need to get my point across to professors, peers, or non-computer science majors.
I have found that writing made that process of communicating easier.
Writing wasn’t always my strong suit growing up.
However, through hard work and dedication, I have grown to become a better writer.

You can’t go through life without pain, so you need to learn how to soothe yourself through it.
My biggest fear is that someday I will be disconnected.
I am afraid of some kinds of humans.
Because some humans are extremists and intolerant.
I am afraid of humans of the extremist, intolerant and mostly ignorant type.
I don't think I'm ugly, that's what matters.
I am not intolerant, on the contrary, I respect everyone's opinion.
I don't like politics.
