I am a current undergraduate Computer Science major at George Mason University.
I will be graduating May 2026 and plan to work in the industry.
After a few years in industry, I will pursue a doctorate in Economics.
I was an intern at Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates at Tufts University as a researcher.
I worked at Tuft’s University AABL (The Assistive Agent Behavior and Learning Lab) from June 2021 to August 2021.
Their main goal is to create new algorithms for human-robot interaction and evaluate whether the algorithm would work in real life.
I researched the changes in human feedback given to a robot learning a task changes over time.
I can't give more information about my research.
My interests are data mining, Machine Learning cloud computing, and mostly artificial intelligence.
I also enjoy analyzing the correlation between economics and technology has in society.
As a computer science major, I would need to get my point across to professors, peers, or non-computer science majors.
I have found that writing made that process of communicating easier.
Writing wasn’t always my strong suit growing up.
However, through hard work and dedication, I have grown to become a better writer.
