I am a commerce student so I didn’t find everything new in this book but there were a few concepts that challenged my beliefs around money and wealth building.
One of the concepts that is now a principle of my life is that “don’t spend money, invest money.”
Neither college nor the typical textbooks ever taught us how to be wealthy, and how to make money. In fact, my college taught me why getting a job is the only source of paying your bills. My college didn’t even prepare me for how to get a good job. College and people around me just stuffed me with the fear of ‘what will happen if you don’t get a job’
Instead of finding what I truly love, I was focused on what if I don’t get a job?
I remember, I started college with the hope of becoming a successful person and eventually giving my parents a luxurious life. But what did my college do to me? My college made me forget my big dreams and inserted fear in my mind.
But wait! Here comes a twist. During the 2020 lockdown, when the colleges were shut down and students were sent back home, I found my refugee in books, and ever since, I am not same anymore. My mindset shifted from getting a good job to creating good jobs.
And here are a few investments that I made in my 20s that actually opened my mind and helped me achieve more.
